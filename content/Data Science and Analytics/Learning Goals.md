### Long-Term Vision
The goal is to develop a data-driven system that can:

- Build a history of "problem areas" — roads where violations frequently occur.
- Potentially integrate with signage data (e.g., exact sign location, its effect on violations).
- Simulate realistic datasets and explore transferable algorithms and analysis tools.
- Eventually experiment with prediction (e.g., linking geography and time of year to likelihood of violations).


### Current Experience
- No experience with tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, or Jupyter.
- No experience with core concepts like data cleansing, predictive analytics, time series, or clustering.
- No access to real data — must simulate realistic datasets.


### Knowledge goals
- Gain knowledge of data analysis workflows, from data ingestion to visualization.
- Understand key concepts such as data cleaning, feature extraction, time series, and basic statistics.
- Learn how data structure and quality affect analysis and predictions.


### Skill goals
- Learn Python with focus on data science libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy).
- Simulate and structure datasets reflecting real-world data scenarios.
- Analyze patterns in data and visualize insights effectively.
- Apply basic prediction techniques using structured data.


### Competencies
- Integrate advanced data components into complex projects.
- Independently formulate questions that can be answered with data.
- Select and apply appropriate tools for structured analysis.
- Plan and execute analysis pipelines and communicate results clearly.
- Relate results to broader patterns or use-cases (e.g., urban design, enforcement strategy).
