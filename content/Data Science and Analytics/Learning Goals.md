# Learning Goals

## Long-Term Vision
The goal is to develop a data-driven system that can:

- Build a history of "problem areas" — roads where violations frequently occur.
- Integrate with signage data (e.g., exact sign location, its effect on violations).
- Simulate realistic datasets and explore transferable algorithms and analysis tools.
- Eventually experiment with prediction (e.g., linking geography and time of year to likelihood of violations).

## Current Experience
- No experience with tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, or Jupyter.
- No experience with core concepts like data cleansing, predictive analytics, time series, or clustering.
- No access to real data — must simulate realistic datasets.
