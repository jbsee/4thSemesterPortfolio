title: Week 35 - System Development Methodology
publish: true
---
### Last week
We started **Iteration 0**, coordinated work schedules, and aligned internal team expectations. We also began formalizing project requirements and created a full **FURPS+ checklist** based on our current understanding of the system.


### Short-Term Plan
This week, the goal is to zero in on a viable and sensible **system development methodology**, taking context and requirements into consideration. This includes choosing a process model and a project management approach.


### Process
When selecting a development methodology, it's especially important to identify **complexities and unknowns** as early as possible. Since each team member is working on different aspects of the system, varying perspectives and priorities must be considered. Recognizing these differences, and any potential conflicts, will be key to forming a viable plan from the outset.

Just as crucial is maintaining alignment with the initial system requirements defined by the product owner. This applies not only during planning but throughout the project. The development approach must therefore ensure **traceability and consistency** with those original expectations.
