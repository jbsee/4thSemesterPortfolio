The project centers around building an app that can scan license plates, associate them with contextual data, and potentially support meaningful analysis and insights based on that data. It forms the basis for both specialization areas: Data Science & Analytics, and Machine Learning.
### Project Idea
The goal is to create an app that lets users, e.g. a roadwork employees, point their phone at a car, snap a photo, automatically read the license plate, and send the information to the relevant authorities in a matter of seconds. This includes car color and could potentially additional data, such as the car model.

The app also logs:
- **Geo-location**
- **Timestamp**
- **Captured image**

## Personal focus
In addition, I'll experiment with creating a tool that builds a dataset over time - highlighting patterns in parking-violations across geography and time.

### Potential areas of interest
-  **Building a violation history** based on location and time.
-  **Studying correlations** between road sign placement and parking violations.
-  **Building a prediction model** to predict when problems are most likely to occur based on location and time.

### Technical Goals
- Experiment with image-based ML techniques to detect license plates, extract text, and identify vehicle color.
- Simulate and structure data similar to what the app would generate.
- Build a pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.
- Implement basic predictive models to explore risk analysis.

### Limitations
- No prior experience with the technologies and tools I expect to use.
- No access to real-world vehicle data (simulation required).

### Concrete output goals
- Simulated datasets representing real-world scenarios.
- Analytical notebooks (Python + Jupyter).
- Weekly reflections and documented experiments.
- Working prototype or backend module simulating license plate scans.
