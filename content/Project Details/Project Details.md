# Project: Number Plate App

The project centers around building an app that can scan car number plates, associate them with contextual data, and potentially support meaningful analysis and insights based on that data. It forms the basis for both specialization areas: Data Science & Analytics, and Machine Learning.
## Project Idea

The idea is to create an app that allows the user, e.g. a roadwork worker, to point their phone at a car, snap a photo, automatically read the number plate, and send the information to the relevant authorities in a matter of seconds. This includes the car color and could potentially include additional data, e.g. car model.

The app also logs:
- **Geo-location**
- **Timestamp**
- **Captured image**
# Personal focus
Additionally I will experiment with creating a tool that can build up a dataset over time â€” highlighting parking-violation patterns across geography and time.
## Potential areas of interest
-  **Building a violation history** based on location and time.
-  **Studying correlations** between road sign placement and parking violations.
-  **Building a prediction model** to predict when problems are most likely to occur based on location and time.
## Technical Goals
- Experiment with image-based ML techniques to detect license plates, extract text, and analyze vehicle color.
- Learn to simulate and structure data similar to what the app would generate.
- Build a pipeline for ingesting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.
- Implement basic predictive models to explore risk forecasting.
## Start of Project Limitations
- Pretty much no experience with any of the technologies and tools I expect to use.
- No access to real-time public vehicle data (simulation required).
## Semester Integration
The project is designed to support the goals of project-based learning:
- Work iterativelv and document learning over time.
- Develop practical experience with Python, data tools, and ML techniques.
- Integrate feedback from guilds, teachers, and peers.
## Concrete output goals
- Simulated datasets representing real-world scenarios.
- Analytical notebooks (Python + Jupyter).
- Weekly reflections and documented experiments.
- Working prototype or backend module simulating number plate scans.
