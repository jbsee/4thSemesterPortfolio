Welcome to my portfolio for the 4th semester of the Datamatiker program at UCL.

The purpose of the portfolio is to document my learning process, experiments, and reflections throughout the semester.
## Focus Areas
I've chosen to specialize in **[[Data Science and Analytics/Learning Goals|Data Science and Analytics]]** and **[[Machine Learning/Learning Goals|Machine Learning]]**.

The foundation of my work this semester is a [[Project Details|group based project]] that will be carried out in cooperation with Odense Municipality. The goal is to produce a functional prototype that automatically infers car information and reads the license plate based on an image of a car in order to automate the process of registering parking offenses in no parking zones, e.g. in relation to roadwork. Furthermore I plan to experiment with implementing a system that analyzes and predicts traffic violation patterns using simulated data.

## Portfolio Structure
The portfolio is organized as follows:
- **[[Project Details|Project]]**: Description, context, and results from the main semester project.

For each of the focus areas:
- **Learning Goals**: Personal objectives and development targets.
- **Weekly Update**: Logs of progress, methods, results and reflections.
- **Experiments**: Smaller trials, simulations, and tests.
