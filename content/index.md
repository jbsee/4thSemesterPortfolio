Welcome to my portfolio for the 4th semester of the Datamatiker program at UCL.
The purpose of this portfolio is to document my learning process, experiments, and reflections throughout the semester.

### Focus Areas
I've chosen to specialize in **[[Data Science and Analytics/Learning Goals|Data Science and Analytics]]** and **[[Machine Learning/Learning Goals|Machine Learning]]**. I've chosen these fields because I enjoy building coherent systems, but I lack experience integrating advanced techniques into the foundation. By diving into Data Science and ML, I hope to gain a solid understanding of how different ideas in these areas can be used to add value to domain-specific solutions. I'm also curious to see whether I enjoy working with them. Hopefully, by the end of the semester, Iâ€™ll know whether I want to work with Data Science and ML going forward.

The foundation of my work this semester is a **[[Project Details|group-based project]]** developed in collaboration with Odense Municipality. The goal is to produce a functional prototype that automatically identifies car details and reads license plates from images - automating the registration of parking violations in no-parking zones (e.g., around roadwork). I also plan to experiment with a system that analyzes and predicts parking violation patterns using simulated data.

The project supports the goals of project-based learning:
- Work iteratively and document learning over time.
- Develop practical experience with Python, data tools, and ML techniques.
- Integrate feedback from guilds, teachers, and peers.

### Portfolio Structure
- **[[Project Details|Project]]**: Description, context, and results from the main semester project.

Each focus area is organized as follows:
- **Learning Goals**: Personal objectives and development targets.
- **Weekly Update**: Logs of progress, methods, results, and reflections.
- **Experiments**: Smaller trials, simulations, and tests.
