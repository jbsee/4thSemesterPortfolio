## Long-Term Vision
The goal is to develop an image-based machine learning system that can:
- Detect number plates in images using object detection models.
- Extract text using OCR and preprocess it for consistency and accuracy.
- Analyze and classify visual features like vehicle color.

Gain experience with
- Evaluating trade-offs in real-world implementations (speed vs. accuracy, model size, etc.).
## Current Experience
- No experience with ML-image processing tools like OpenCV, YOLO, or EasyOCR.
- No experience training or fine-tuning models.
- No hands-on experience with deployment of ML in a computer vision pipeline.
