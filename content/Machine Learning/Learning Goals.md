### Long-Term Vision
The goal is to develop an image-based machine learning system that can:
- Detect cars and license plates in images using object detection models.
- Extract text using OCR and preprocess it for consistency and accuracy.
- Analyze and classify visual features like vehicle color.


### Current Experience
- No experience with ML-image processing tools like OpenCV, YOLO, or EasyOCR.
- No experience training or fine-tuning models.
- No hands-on experience with deployment of ML in a computer vision pipeline.


### Knowledge goals
- Gain knowledge of image-based machine learning models, including object detection and optical character recognition (OCR).
- Gain knowledge of preprocessing image data and classifying visual features like color.
- Understand basic theory and practice behind used tools (such as OpenCV, EasyOCR, and YOLO).


### Skill goals
- Become fluent in Python and learn relevant Python-tools.
- Use image processing tools to detect and extract data from images (e.g. using HSV, OCR).
- Assess the output quality of OCR and object detection.
- Apply core techniques to build an ML pipeline from image to structured data.
- Gain experience with evaluating trade-offs in real-world ML implementations (accuracy vs. performance, model size, etc.).


### Competencies
- Acquire new knowledge independently within ML based on self-directed learning goals.
- Integrate ML components into complex projects.
